## Hey Mr.Dejardins 

I have **learned** that *github* is quite extensive and could be a good tool once I get more comfortable with it. 
I am kind of just trying not to mess anything up in the repository right now. 

-**Things I am confused about** 
- Not really confused on anything just need some time to get comfortable moving around the site. 
* I do not know if I did the pull request correctly. Hopefully I did not mess anything up  
- I thought styling texts on a markdown file would be a little confusing. Turns out it is not.
